## Problem Title:  
SIH 1653: Web-based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software

## Problem Description:  
**Background:**  
Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO.  
**Description:**  
The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/expertise of the applicant, and the responses should also be of relevance with respect to the question asked.  
**Expected Solution:**  
The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real-life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions with respect to the area/expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy with respect to the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/her suitability against the advertised post.

## Problem Creator's Organization  
Ministry of Defence

## Idea  
A web-based application designed to facilitate the interview process for DRDO’s Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) by providing a structured and fair interviewing system that evaluates the candidates objectively, based on both the relevance of questions and the quality of answers.

## Proposed Solution / Architecture Diagram  

- **User Interface (UI):** A simple and interactive interface for both the interviewers and candidates.  
- **Backend:** An AI-powered engine that matches questions with candidates' expertise levels, grades their responses, and generates scores.  
- **Database:** A secure and scalable database to store candidate profiles, interview data, and scores.  
- **Analytics Dashboard:** A dashboard to provide interviewers with an overview of the candidate's performance, including scores for each section of the interview.  
- **AI Algorithms:** To assess the relevancy of the questions asked, and to evaluate the quality of the candidate’s responses.

## Use Cases  
1. **Recruiter Perspective:**  
   - Interviewers can input interview questions that align with the job role.  
   - Real-time evaluation of candidates based on predefined criteria.  
   - Generation of scores and recommendations for hiring.  

2. **Candidate Perspective:**  
   - Respond to questions in real-time during the interview.  
   - Receive feedback on the relevance of answers.  
   - Gain insight into strengths and weaknesses based on the interview performance.

3. **Admin Perspective:**  
   - Set up and manage interview sessions.  
   - View and track overall interview progress and outcomes.

## Technology Stack  
- **Frontend:** React.js or Angular for building an interactive UI.  
- **Backend:** Node.js or Python (Flask/Django) for server-side development.  
- **Database:** MongoDB or PostgreSQL for data storage.  
- **AI/ML:** Python libraries like TensorFlow, Scikit-learn for NLP and scoring algorithms.  
- **Cloud:** AWS or Google Cloud for hosting and scalability.  
- **Authentication:** OAuth 2.0 for secure login/authentication.

## Dependencies  
- **Web Browser:** Chrome, Firefox, or Edge for best performance.  
- **Node.js:** Required for backend development.  
- **Python:** For implementing AI models and evaluation algorithms.  
- **MongoDB/PostgreSQL:** For database management.  
- **Cloud Hosting:** AWS or Google Cloud for scalability and deployment.
